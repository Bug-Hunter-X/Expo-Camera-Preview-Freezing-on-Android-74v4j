# Expo Camera Preview Freezing on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes on certain Android devices.  The issue is particularly noticeable when switching between cameras or modes. The provided `bug.js` file reproduces the problem; `bugSolution.js` offers a potential workaround.  See the detailed description and potential solution below.

## Bug Description

The Expo Camera component's preview freezes intermittently on some Android devices.  This is likely due to inefficiencies in memory management or resource allocation within the Expo Camera implementation.  The exact cause isn't pinpointed, but the issue tends to surface under specific usage patterns (like switching between front and rear cameras).

## Potential Solution

The proposed solution (`bugSolution.js`) involves adding error handling and potentially implementing more aggressive memory management strategies (though those are not shown in this example, as a complete solution would require more investigation). This is only a preliminary step and further investigation is encouraged.

## To Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `expo start`. 
5. Test on multiple Android devices to see the error (consistent reproduction isn't guaranteed due to the nature of the bug).

## Additional Notes

This issue is device-dependent and might not manifest on all Android devices.  Thorough testing is crucial. Reporting this issue to the Expo community and providing detailed logs could be beneficial for wider community contributions to finding a better solution.
